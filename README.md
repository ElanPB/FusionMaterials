# FusionMaterials

This project will focus on precurring the relavant cross sections for the effects of high energy neutrons on materials present in HTS magnets and essentail for Magnetic Confinement Fusion.

The current list of important elements include (all elements found in REBCO tape):
- REBCO: Y, Ba, Cu, O
- Hastelloy: Ni, Cr, Mo
- Substrate: Ag
- Buffer layer:  ???

The relevant cross sections for all isotopes of the elements listed above with an abundance greater than 10\% will be looked at

Relevant cross sections include:
- For gas production (any neutron induced reaction with an ejectile of either p or alpha)
  - (n,alpha)
  - (n,n+p)
  - (n,n+alpha)
  - (n,p+alpha)
- For displacement
  - Elastic
  - Inelastic
  - (n,gamma)
